ðŸ‘‹ I'm a backend software engineer based near Boise, Idaho in the United States. I've been working in the industry for about six years, primarily focused on building microservices using languages like `Go`, `Java`, and `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`.

I enjoy [building stuff](https://github.com/jaredpetersen "GitHub") in my free time. Sometimes I write about it on my [blog](/blog "Blog").
