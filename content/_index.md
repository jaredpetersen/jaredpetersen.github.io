ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you!

I'm a backend software engineer based in the Portland, Oregon area of the United States. I've been working in the industry for about five years now, primarily focused on building scalable, REST-based microservices using languages like `Java`, `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`, and `Go`.

I enjoy [building stuff](https://github.com/jaredpetersen) in my free time as well. Sometimes I write about it on my [blog]({{< ref "blog" >}} "Blog").
