ðŸ‘‹ I'm a backend software engineer based near Boise, Idaho in the United States. I've been writing software professionally for about 8 years in a number of different industries. Right now, I'm working on software used to pool freight.

I enjoy [building stuff](https://github.com/jaredpetersen "GitHub") in my free time. Sometimes I write about it on my [blog](/blog "Blog").
